Test cases define what must be done to test a system, including the steps executed in the system, the input data values that are entered into the system and the results that are expected throughout test case execution. Using test cases allows developers and testers to discover errors that may have occurred during development or defects that were missed.The benefits of an effective test case include:

1)Guaranteed good test coverage.

2)Reduced maintenance and software support costs.

3)Reusable test cases.

4)Confirmation that the software satisfies end-user requirements.

5)Improved quality of software and user experience

	**The components of a test case include:	**

1)Test name: A title that describes the functionality or feature that the test is verifying.

2)Test ID: Typically a numeric or alphanumeric identifier that QA engineers and testers use to group test cases into test suites.

3)Objective: Also called the description, this important component describes what the test intends to verify in one to two sentences.

4)References: Links to user stories, design specifications or requirements that the test is expected to verify.

5)Prerequisites: Any conditions that are necessary for the tester or QA engineer to perform the test.

6)Test setup: This component identifies what the test case needs to run correctly, such as app version, operation system, date and time requirements and security specifications.

7)Test steps: Detailed descriptions of the sequential actions that must be taken to complete the test.

8)Expected results: An outline of how the system should respond to each test step
